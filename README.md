# ErlotinibGefitinib

In this project the PKPD properties of Erlotinib and Gefitinib are investigated (More details will follow as the project matures).

The analysis of the data, and the modelling of the PKPD is organised in Jupyter notebooks. We start with modelling the control group, 
and will gradually build up the inference of the Erlotinib/ Gefitinib specfic parameters.
