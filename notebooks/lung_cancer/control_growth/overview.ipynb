    "In [1], the tumour growth inhibition (TGI) PKPD model of Erlotinib and Gefitinib was derived from two separate *in vivo* experiments. In particular, the growth of patient-derived tumour explants LXF A677 (adenocarcinoma of the lung) and cell line-derived tumour xenografts VXF A431 (vulva cancer) in mice were monitored. Each experiment comprised a control growth group and three groups that were treated with either Erlotinib or Gefitinib at one of three dose levels. Treatments were orally administered once a day.\n",

    "In this notebook, we focus on establishing a good understanding of the untreated tumour growth. In particular, this will allow us to derive posteriors for the growth parameters, that may inform the choice of priors for the full TGI-PKPD model inference."
