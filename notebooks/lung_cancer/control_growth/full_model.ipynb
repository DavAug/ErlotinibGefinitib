    "# Control Growth PD Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In [1], the tumour growth inhibition (TGI) PKPD model of Erlotinib and Gefitinib was derived from two separate in vivo experiments. In particular, the growth of patient-derived tumour explants LXF A677 (adenocarcinoma of the lung) and cell line-derived tumour xenografts VXF A431 (vulva cancer) in mice were monitored. Each experiment comprised a control growth group and three groups that were treated with either Erlotinib or Gefitinib at one of three dose levels. Treatments were orally administered once a day.\n",
    "\n",
    "The population PD model for the tumour growth in absence of any treatement is a hierarchical model which consists of a structural model, a population model and an error model. Each sub-model captures a different aspect of the tumour growth biology, and is parameterised by a set of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we introduce the population PD model for the untreated lung cancer tumour growth in absence of any treatment reported in [1]."
