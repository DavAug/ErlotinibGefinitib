    "# Modelling the Tumour Growth Inhibitory Effects of Erlotinib and Gefitinib: Lung Cancer\n",
    "\n",
    "In [1], the tumour growth inhibition (TGI) PKPD model of Erlotinib and Gefitinib was derived from two separate in vivo experiments. In particular, the growth of patient-derived tumour explants LXF A677 (adenocarcinoma of the lung) and cell line-derived tumour xenografts VXF A431 (vulva cancer) in mice were monitored. Each experiment comprised a control growth group and three groups that were treated with either Erlotinib or Gefitinib at one of three dose levels. Treatments were orally administered once a day.\n",
